# Ludaro-Personal-Menu-LPMenu-
We all know that krz_personalmenu is cool, but outdated and alot of people need an personalmenu thats new, fresh innovative and actually just not 7 years old.


this is my Own Personalmenu <3

its made entierly in Nativeui with association with kimi_callbacks --> https://github.com/Kiminaze/kimi_callbacks

to use this you need NativeUI or NativeUIReloaded (both should work) an sql script (ox or async), kimi_callbacks and esx above 1.1 

Right now only Inventory and Wallet are working, im heavily working on it.

the code shouldnt be looked upon i tried alot of new stuff and had a seizure while writing it.
